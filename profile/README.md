Big Local News is a program at Stanford University that empowers journalists to better cover their community. 

Our team authors open-source software that gathers and refines hard-to-obtain public records about policing, politics, public health, employment and other topics. We then collaborate with reporters to analyze the records, find stories and produce journalism that makes an impact.

Our website at [biglocalnews.org](https://biglocalnews.org/) offers a free archiving service that allows journalists to store and share data.
