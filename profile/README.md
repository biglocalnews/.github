![BIG LOCAL NEWS](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/biglocalnews/.github/main/profile/github-840x200.png)

Itâ€™s too hard for local journalists to access public records about policing, public health, government and other vital topics.

From its base at Stanford University, Big Local News gathers data, builds tools and collaborates with reporters to produce journalism that makes an impact. Its website at [biglocalnews.org](https://biglocalnews.org) offers a free archiving service for journalists to store and share data.
