Big Local News is a program at Stanford University that collects local data to find stories and produce journalism with impact.

Our team authors open-source software, found below, that gathers and refines hard-to-obtain public records about policing, politics, public health, employment and other topics. We work with reporters to analyze the records and break news.

Our website at [biglocalnews.org](https://biglocalnews.org/) allows journalists to pool data and work together.
